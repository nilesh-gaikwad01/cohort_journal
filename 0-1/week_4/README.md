# Summary of the Week 4

- Revised Express fundamentals (server setup, routing, JSON handling)  
- Built complete CRUD operations using REST API design  
- Understood middlewares and how they control request → response cycle  
- Implemented logger, validator, and route-level middlewares  
- Used Zod for schema validation and learned how to validate request bodies  
- Created a global error-handling middleware for clean and consistent error responses  
- Learned JWT authentication: signing tokens, verifying tokens, protecting routes  
- Built a working login + register system using an in-memory database  
- Connected a simple frontend login form with the backend authentication API  
- Tested all backend features using Postman (CRUD + validation + auth)
