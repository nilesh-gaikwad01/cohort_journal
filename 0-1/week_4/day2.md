# Week 4 – Day 2: 

##  what I learned Today 

- Create, Read, Update, Delete operations     
- Handling POST, GET, PUT, DELETE routes 
- Working with in-memory data storage using the array  
- Updating & deleting data using params

### Practice:
Build CRUD for a "Users" collection.
- GET "/" - server response
- POST `/users` - Create  
- GET `/users` - Read   
- PUT `/users/:id` - Update  
- DELETE `/users/:id` - Delete  
- Testing all routes with Postman
