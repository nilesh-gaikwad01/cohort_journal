# Week 4 – Day 1: 

##  what I learned Today 

- What Express is & why it's used  
- Express server setup  
- express.json() middleware  
- Basic routing (GET, POST)  
- Route parameters  
- Sending JSON responses  
- File structure for Express projects  

## Practice:
- Build simple routes: GET `/`,POST `/user`, POST `contact`, PUT`/user/:id` .
- ` Server running at http://localhost:3003"` 

- Test routes using Postman  
- Apply clean folder structure (routes, controllers)
